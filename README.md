## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tommy, a creative web developer from Belfast living in London.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

I work at [CastRooms](https://castrooms.com/), a new social streaming site for music performers and fans. I'm the ~only~ best Engineer in the company, so it's a lot of fun and I'm learning loads. In my spare time, I'm working on a side project that's way too early to share.

I've built some useful things for myself like [Lineup.fun](https://lineup.fun/), and some silly things, like [Is It Shorts Weather Today](https://www.isitshortsweathertoday.com/).

I like writing HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. I enjoy working with Svelte a lot, but I'm just as comfortable with React. I previously worked with Ruby, but now I write Elixir almost daily.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Svelte and SvelteKit
- LiveView
- Three.js and WebGL

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

- Elixir
- Svelte
- WebSockets
- LiveStreaming
